Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## Data type Partition Key

In this week, to use sql Date type as the partition key has been supported. And there are several documents and discusses updated in this week, thanks to all of the TensorBase contributors. 

Distributed query on the top of DataFusion/Ballista is in flight. Furthermore, one of core contributors is preparing some great works in both data warehouse and Rust community. It is hoped that primary exciting things could be shown in the next week. ✈️

## Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan Continues

This plan is still in the phase of student application. If you are a student all over the world and interested to contribute to TensorBase with sponsorship, it is a very good opportunity to [apply for this plan](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/orgdetail/tensorbase?lang=en) to work together with TensorBase's core contributors. Go to [TensorBase community](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) for more infos.

## Help Wanted

[Try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
