Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## Great Bug Fixes

From the warm discussion about the [latest TensorBase on the RISC-V porting work](https://tensorbase.io/2021/06/08/sql_on_riscv_in_rust.html), we are excited to welcome many new friends. üëè

In this week, we fixed several usage-mismatched bugs from Arrow and TensorBase. After this, we got [a new great release](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/releases/tag/v2021.06.16) which supports missing date and string casting in filtering. We think this revision is great for having primary SQL functionalities ready. And we decide to start the journey of engine performance.

## Performance Rocket Lift Off üöÄ

In this week, one big changes in architecture is that we move the Arrow and DataFusion into the core of TensorBase. Because we want to start the fix the kernel performance for our community, we will experimentize new built-in and kernels from the performance side in the TensorBase. We will feedback the result to the community, because we want Arrow and DataFusion to be the fastest SQL engine in the world.üöÄ

## Help Wanted
