Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## Summer 2021 Already Started ðŸŒž

In this week, TensorBase community keeps high-speed iteration as in the last week. 

We add many ClickHouse compatible builtin functions into TensorBase. We refresh our contributing code styles, and checked new prepared server_mysql and ballista crates into the repo for next iterations. The biggest improvement is that we fix the timezone supports for our datetime builtin functions to align with the of that in ClickHouse. This means that you have most same behaviors and results in TensorBase like those in ClickHouse. It is a nice time to test against with TensorBase for your workload!

Students for the summer 2021 have come into the community. [Detailed tasks](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Achallenge%2Fsummer-2021) are out. TensorBase is looking forward to more people entering and helping the community this summer!ðŸ’—

## Help Wanted

[Try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
