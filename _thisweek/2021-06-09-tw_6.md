Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ SQL on RISC-V Chip in Rust

In this week, we release out the first version of work to port TensorBase to the RISC-V arch. 

We are proud to announce that TensorBase is the first data warehouse which makes ["SQL on RISC-V Chip in Rust"](https://tensorbase.io/2021/06/08/sql_on_riscv_in_rust.html) become true! The community now is welcome to share your working ideas for the next-gen data analysis on the next-gen open ISA chip.
