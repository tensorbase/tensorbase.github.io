Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## More Primary Data Types  

In this week, more data types Float, Date and Decimal64 has been added into source tree. This provides a solid base for the following TPC-H benchmarks.

## TPC-H Q1 Result Out 

In this week, TensorBase team has [evaluated the TPC-H Q1](https://github.com/tensorbase/benchmarks/blob/main/tpch.md) in a full workflow from data ingestion to query! That means TensorBase is becoming into a good sharp for single node. There are cases we need to improve to make all queries to pass. TensorBase team will work with Arrow and DataFusion to make this happened ASAP.

## More Project Maintenances

A batch of github actions has been added to the project. Therefore, new contributions can be well guarded now. Welcome Rustaceans to go and play with TensorBase!

## Help Wanted

It is hoped that you can [try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). 

It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
