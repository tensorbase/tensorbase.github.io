Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## More Builtin Functions And Data Types 

There are some differences between ClickHouse protocol and Apache Arrow spec. For example, the Date type in ClickHouse is 16-bit length but 32-bit in Arrow spec. To enable the zero-copy reading and writing, the 16-bit Date support and a to_date builtin function have been added to extend the Arrow codebase. 

TensorBase is honored to let users have maximum performance through our work! 

## Join the Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan

It is excited to announce that TensorBase has joined the ["Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan"](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/homepage?lang=en). If you are a student all over the world and interested to contribute to TensorBase with sponsorship, it is a very good opportunity to [apply for this plan](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/orgdetail/tensorbase?lang=en) to work together with TensorBase's core contributors. You will have a deep understanding on how to code for one industry level big data infrastructure after the summer journey to TensorBase. [An idea page](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/summer_2021_ospp.md) has been prepared in TensorBase community. All contributors are waiting for you!


## Help Wanted

It is hoped that you can [try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). 

It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
