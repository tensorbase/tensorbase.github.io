Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## RBAC subsystem  

In this week, TensorBase goes into a relatively quiet period.

In this week, TensorBase has got a initial RFC for the RBAC(Role-Based Access Control) subsystem. In the coming RBAC, we will propose a self-hosted concise authentication and authorization for our users. For small businesses and dependencies-minimized users, this is great to have. In the future, we will support more third-party authentication systems for more big-enterprise integration.

In this week, we are rethinking the fundamental problem about several subsystems. We are believing wider helps for and from whole Rust community is critical for the advance of TensorBase. So, TensorBase is planning more interesting libraries for whole Rust community.

In this week, TensorBase welcomes an new contributor to sent out his first contribution for introducing the default value/expression support in the schema. This PR is under great improvement. All the helps are really appreciated! Thank you! ðŸ’—

## Help Wanted
