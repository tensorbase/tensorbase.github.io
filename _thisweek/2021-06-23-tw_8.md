Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## More ClickHouse Compatible Builtin Functions

In this week, we pin out our [big picture for roadmap](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues/141). One task is to start the ClickHouse compatibility work to more CH side builtin functions available in our TensorBase. Some Arrow-Datafusion functions are similar to CH's but has different names. For this, it is ok to just rename them. But for other missings, a new one needs to implement. 

## Performance Rocket Lift Off

In this week, we experimented a fast version of toYear for TensorBase which was **~80% faster** than that of Arrow temporal computing kernel. This is great!ðŸš€ And in the next week, we want to see if we can tunning the performance of TensorBase to that of ClickHouse in the group-by query in [our quick benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues/143) via new experiments. 


## Help Wanted

[Try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
