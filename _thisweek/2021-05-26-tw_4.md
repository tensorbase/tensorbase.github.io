Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a modern big data warehouse in Rust. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase wants to provide a new big data infrastructure for every business in this era.

## More Data Types

In this week, data type FixString, and shortcut types Decimal32 and Decimal64 has been added into the base codes. The missing wildcard in select clause problem has also been fixed. In this week, we also get much more precious feedbacks from users. Then, there are [more issues comes out](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) in this week. It is welcome for TensorBase. Great dog foods to eat! üçª 


## Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan Continues

TensorBase has announced to join the ["Summer 2021 of Open Source Promotion Plan"](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/homepage?lang=en) last week. It is really great to see that there are some students showing their interests in TensorBase and its tasks!

This plan is still in the phase of student application. If you are a student all over the world and interested to contribute to TensorBase with sponsorship, it is a very good opportunity to [apply for this plan](https://summer.iscas.ac.cn/#/org/orgdetail/tensorbase?lang=en) to work together with TensorBase's core contributors. Go to [TensorBase project](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) page to get more infos.

## Help Wanted

It is hoped that you can [try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). 

It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
