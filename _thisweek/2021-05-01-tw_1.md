Welcome to "This Week in TensorBase" weekly newsletter.

[TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) is a new big data warehousing with modern efforts. With the help of Rust engineering, TensorBase hopes to change the status quo of bigdata system: low efficient, hard to use and understand, not evolve with modern infrastructures.

## String Data Type Ready 

The TensorBase has committed [the primary String data type support](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/tree/support_string_type). In the meantime, a great effort is carried on  several subsystems of TensorBase to make zero-copy varied length store and query happened. This means, TensorBase

1. supports almost all primary SQL data types.
2. close to support the whole process of TPC-H evaluation: from data ingestion to query

## TensorBase Book

The first one in a series of *TensorBase Book* articles has been published in this month's Rust Monthly Mag(Chinese):

* [Chinese version](https://rustmagazine.github.io/rust_magazine_2021/chapter_4/tensorbase.html)
* [English version](/2021/05/01/base_series_1.html)

And we welcome all interested friends come to write this book together!

## Two Hour Feat Flash Challenge

From 2021.05.01 to 05.05, TensorBase opens a small challenge: ["two hour feat flash"](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase#rocket-quick-news). During this period, You can try to use two hours to roll out a contribution with one hour mentoring from the committer.

Several TPC-H requirements are embedded in this challenge. So, you will push great progress of TensorBase just in simple two hours!

## Help Wanted

It is hoped that you can [try TensorBase in *one minute*](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/blob/main/docs/get_started_users.md). 

It is really appreciated that you play TensorBase with data ingestion, queries, or any hacks in any way you want and [feedback the bugs or anything you want](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues) to the TensorBase community. 

More helps on [help wanted issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or [good first issues](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are appreciated as well.
