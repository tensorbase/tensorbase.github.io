I've just joined the [first Rust China Conf](https://2020conf.rustcc.cn/schedule.html) with TensorBase.

In this talk, the "where-from", "where-in" and "where-to" of TensorBase as a Rust Based open source project have been presented. Because of the time limitation, I skip the technical details. You can consult [sources](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase) and [another talk](https://tensorbase.io/2020/11/08/rustfest2020.html) to get some more info on the technical side of things.

Ancient Chinese saying says, "to teach fishing is better than to give fish". So, I hope you could see more when you stand at the sky of 100,000 miles high. I also plan to share more documents from and experiences of building TensorBase.

Here is the presentation.

And there is also a video (in Chinese) which could be [seen here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yy4y1e7zR?p=25).

The great milestone finished before the conference was the primary completion of a new base server. We do the dirty work for our users and help them to achieve engineering excellence. That's the new engineering TensorBase wants to start. Futhermore, I am really looking forward to your [joining the community](https://tensorbase.io/2021/01/01/plans.html).

The most fascinating thing, which I found at the conference, is that we have a strong and heart-warming community! That's Rust!

Let's Rust!
