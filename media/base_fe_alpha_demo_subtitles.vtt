00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Firstly start TensorBase FE server (upper, use port 9528) and ClickHouse server (lower, use default port 9000)

1
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000
Then use ClickHouse client to connect to 
TensorBase FE server (upper) and ClickHouse server (lower)

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Note ClickHouse client has prompted different server side infos
TensorBase FE (upper) and ClickHouse (lower)

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let do some metadata managements
TensorBase FE (upper) and ClickHouse (lower)

4
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Try system.numbers as a low-hanging fruit
TensorBase FE (upper) and ClickHouse (lower)

5
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Note, the result correctness could be verified as well
TensorBase FE (upper) and ClickHouse (lower)

6
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Use table trips_lite_n10m to demo csv data importing from clickHouse-client

7
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You can use the same command to ingest to TensorBase FE like in ClickHouse

8
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Let's do some real world queries against TensorBase FE (upper) and ClickHouse (lower)

9
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Let's see an ad-hoc change.
