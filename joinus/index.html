            In TensorBase, You work with well thought and practiced database engineers who challenge the unknowable
            analytical
            database patterns and performance limits, using the bleeding edge .
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            [TensorBase](https://github.com/tensorbase/tensorbase), a modern open source real-time data warehouse based
            on Rust.
            It focuses on open source big data storage and analysis infrastructure, so that the value behind big data
            can
            benefit every individual and enterprise in this era.

            Team introduction: My own [profile is here](https://jinmingjian.xyz/resume/). TensorBase has received a seed
            round
            of investment from the Qiji Innovation Forum (formerly YC China) under Dr. Qi Lu, and Dr. Qi Lu is our
            partner!

            Open source, benefit others and achieve oneself. Innovation and integrity are surprising. The future of
            infrastructure must be open source and innovative. At present, TensorBase has a very good community and
            results.
            ClickHouse's core leader Alexey Milovidov submitted a PR to TensorBase. For the first time, China's open
            source data
            infrastructure project has won the respect of foreign open source data warehouse leaders. We can be proud!

            I have a dream: to help each other, explore and work hard with a group of Chinese engineers, to do something
            that
            can be at the forefront of this era, and can make myself grow, be happy and proud. I am waiting for such a
            group of
            people:

            1. Willing to use the Rust language and contribute to the Rust open source community (I hope you don't treat
            the
            language as a tool, although it is objectively a tool).
            2. Have the spirit of innovation and exploration, willing to work in no man's land.
            + Kernel direction: Have practice or interest in one or more fields such as data engineering,
            high-performance
            systems, high-performance computing, compilers, Linux kernel, distributed, concurrency, and network
            protocols.
            + Community: Front-end or Technical writer who are interested in Rust/data.
            3. Love to do something like TensorBase, and love to work with a group of people like TensorBase.

            Full-time or internships are acceptable, but interns need to be onsite.

            Compared with major manufacturers, we provide competitive salary + options.
